        The cursor is a point of no return: once it advances, the next cycle
        reads the issue as unchanged. A pending action staged before this call
        therefore has to land with it or not at all -- committed separately, a
        failure between the two leaves a claim with no cursor (the retry
        collides with its own key and the issue is stuck for good) or a cursor
        with no claim (the update is silently dropped). One commit has neither
        half-state, and it is why `stage_action` exists beside `claim_action`.

        Rollback is NOT owned here. `cycle()` is the only caller that stages
        anything beside this, and its per-issue handler already aborts the
        transaction for every failure in the issue -- including ones that never
        reach this method. A second owner here would duplicate that for one
        path and still not cover the others.
